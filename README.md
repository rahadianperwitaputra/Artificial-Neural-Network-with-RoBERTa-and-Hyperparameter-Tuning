# Artificial-Neural-Network-with-RoBERTa-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning
Artificial Neural Network (ANN), it is one of the classification methods used as a reference in personality prediction, this method has good performance in classification. To overcome the overfitting while training the data, we used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) technique to handle the imbalance data. Other  features such as Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) and  Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training Approach (RoBERTa) with hyperparameter tuning can increase the performance of  the system that we have built.
